# EconomicAnalysis
 Creating a repository to review past and current economic systems and what is happening really. This will allow people to really see with data what is happening and if individuals or goverment officials are just pulling information from nowhere or deseving us. Not only will there be code but notes on the subject as well using the Obsidian software.
